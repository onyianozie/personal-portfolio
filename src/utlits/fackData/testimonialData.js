        review: ` had the pleasure to work with Dre as his manager for 2+ years. He is a highly skilled individual who has mastered many skills through a growth mindset of always willing to learn. I can always depend on him to take on a project and lead it from start to finish. The output of his work is always beyond everyone's expectations as he always goes the extra mile and puts the extra hours to get things done well. As his ex-manager, he earns my highest recommendation. Any company would be lucky to have Dre on their team.`
